# Find-My-Coffee-App
  Built by baristas, this app will narrow your options and simplify your search by focusing only on local specialty coffee shops- you’ll be able to have a more individualized experience knowing that your needs for elevated coffee will be met while supporting Saint Louis businesses. 
  The app will have a “near me” map feature, a social media links page, an information page, and a time function to ensure the user won’t be tempted to visit a cafe that’s closed. The goal is to make the search for a cafe simpler, so you won’t spend needless time figuring out what you’re in the mood for.
